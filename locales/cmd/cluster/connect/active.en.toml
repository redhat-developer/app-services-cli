one = '''
Connect your application services to your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
The kubeconfig file is used to connect to the cluster and identify the context.

A service account is created and mounted as a secret into your cluster. 
This enables you to mount credentials directly to your application.

This command works in two modes:

  * If the RHOAS Operator is installed in the cluster, you can use it to bind your instance automatically.

  * Create the secret only. This mode does not require the Operator to be installed.

You can interactively select the service instance by using the "--interactive-select" flag
