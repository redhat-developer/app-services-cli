Connectors commands

### Synopsis

With Red Hat OpenShift Connectors, you can create and configure connections between Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka and third-party systems. You can configure Connectors that retrieve data (data source Connectors) and Connectors that specify where to send data (data sink Connectors).

To get started:
1. Decide which type of connector you want to create.
   Use the "rhoas connector type list" command to see a list of connector types
2. Build a configuration file based on one of the connector types.
   Use the "rhoas connector build" command to build a configuration file.
3. Optionally, edit the configuration file.
   Use a text editor of your choice to edit the configuration file.
4. Create a Connectors instance by specifying the configuration file.
   Use the "rhoas connector create" command to create a Connectors instance.
5. Start the Connectors instance by using the "rhoas connector start" command.
6. Stop the Connectors instance by using the "rhoas connector stop" command.


### Examples

```
   
# List all connector types
rhoas connector type list

# Build a Connectors configuration file named "my_aws_lambda_connector.json" that is based on the "aws_lambda_sink_0.1" connector type
rhoas connector build --name=my_aws_lambda_connector --type=--type=aws_lambda_sink_0.1

# Create a Connectors instance by specifying a configuration file
rhoas connector create --file=myconnector.json

# Update an existing Connectors instance by specifying a configuration file
rhoas connector update --id=my-connector --file=myconnector.json

# List of Connectors instances
rhoas connector list

# Start the Connectors instance with ID my-connector
rhoas connector start --id=my-connector

# Stop the current Connectors instance
rhoas connector stop

# Delete a Connectors instance with ID my-connector
rhoas connector delete --id=my-connector

```
