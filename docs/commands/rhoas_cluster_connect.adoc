Connect your services to Kubernetes or OpenShift

[discrete]
== Synopsis

Connect your application services to an Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

Note: Before you can connect your application service to OpenShift, you need to install the RHOAS Operator in your OpenShift cluster. For installation instructions, see https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-guides/tree/main/service-discovery#installing-the-rhoas-operator-on-openshift.

When you connect an application service to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, this command uses the kubeconfig file (or the KUBECONFIG environment variable) to connect to the cluster and identify the context.

After identifying the context, the RHOAS Operator creates a service account and mounts it as a secret in your cluster. If your cluster has a service account already, the service account is refreshed.

Finally, the RHOAS Operator creates a Kafka Request Object, which the Service Binding Operator (https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator) uses to create a "ServiceBinding" object.

After running this command, you need to grant access for the service account that was created by the RHOAS Operator to access your application service. For the Kafka application service, enter the following command:

  $ rhoas kafka acl grant-access --producer --consumer --service-account your-sa --topic all --group all

For the Service Registry application service, enter this command:

  $ rhoas service-registry role add --role=DEVELOPER --service-account your-sa
