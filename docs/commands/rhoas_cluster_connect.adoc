== rhoas cluster connect

Connect your services to Kubernetes or OpenShift

=== Synopsis

Connect your application services to your Kubernetes or OpenShift
cluster. The kubeconfig file is used to connect to the cluster and
identify the context.

A service account is created and mounted as a secret into your cluster.
This enables you to mount credentials directly to your application.

This command works in two modes:

* If the RHOAS Operator is installed in the cluster, you can use it to
bind your instance automatically.
* Create the secret only. This mode does not require the Operator to be
installed.

You can interactively select the service instance by using the
``â€“interactive-select'' flag

....
