Create a service account

[discrete]
== Synopsis

Create a service account with credentials that are saved to a file.
			
Applications and tools use these service account credentials to authenticate 
and interact with your application services.

You must specify an output format into which the credentials will be stored.
  - env (default): Store credentials in an env file as environment variables
  - json: Store credentials in a JSON file
  - properties: Store credentials in a properties file, which is typically used in Java-related technologies.
