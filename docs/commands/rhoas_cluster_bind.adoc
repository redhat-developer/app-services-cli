== Synopsis

Command allows you to connect services created by connect command to your application
running on OpenShift or Kubernetes platform.
Bind will scan your namespace and detect all application deployments that you can connect your
services with.

Bind command detects Kubernetes deployments and inject managed services credentials to them.
For information about what credentials are injected please refer to individual services
Command will inject credentials as files into `/bindings` folder inside your application.

ServiceBindingOperator resource if you have it installed on your cluster
