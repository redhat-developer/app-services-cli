Connect your RHOAS services to Kubernetes or OpenShift applications

[discrete]
== Synopsis

Connect an application service to your application running on OpenShift or Kubernetes. This command uses the Service Binding Operator to inject an application running on the cluster with the parameters required to connect to the application service.

When you perform service binding, the Service Binding Operator automatically injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application (you can see these files in the “/bindings” directory in your application). This means that the application automatically detects and uses the injected connection parameters.

In general, this automatic injection and detection of connection parameters eliminates the need to manually configure an application to connect to an application service. This is a particular advantage if you have many applications in your project that you want to connect to the application service.

If your application uses a “DeploymentConfig”, you must use the “--deployment-config" flag so that your application can be detected.
