          Specifies the search criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
          using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username
          starting with `my`:

          ```sql
          username like 'my%'
          ```

          The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the subscriptions labeled by `foo=bar`,

          ```sql
          labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then

          returned.

          For example, in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username:

          Specifies the search criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
          using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username
          starting with `my`:

          ```sql
          username like 'my%'
          ```

          The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the subscriptions labeled by `foo=bar`,

          ```sql
          labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          all the accounts that the user has permission to see will be
          returned.

          similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
          using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username

          ```sql
          username like 'my%'
          ```

          Specifies the search criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
          using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username
          starting with `my`:

          ```sql
          username like 'my%'
          ```

          The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the subscriptions labeled by `foo=bar`,

          ```sql
          labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          all the accounts that the user has permission to see will be
          returned.

          For example, in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username:

          ```sql
          username asc
          ```

          Or in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username _and_ first name:

          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then

          similar to the syntax of the _order by_ clause of an SQL statement,
          but using the names of the json attributes / column of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username:

          ```sql
          username asc
          ```

          Or in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username _and_ first name:

          ```sql
          username asc, firstName asc
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          no explicit ordering will be applied.

          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username

          The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.

          ```sql
          labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then

          returned.

          Specifies the search criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
          using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username
          starting with `my`:

          ```sql
          username like 'my%'
          ```

          The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.
          For example, in order to retrieve all the subscriptions labeled by `foo=bar`,

          ```sql
          labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          all the accounts that the user has permission to see will be
          returned.

          For example, in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username:

          ```

          Or in order to retrieve all accounts ordered by username _and_ first name:

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then

        Specifies the search criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
        similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an SQL statement,
        using the names of the json attributes / column names of the account.
        For example, in order to retrieve all the accounts with a username
        starting with `my`:

        ```sql
        username like 'my%'
        ```

        The search criteria can also be applied on related resource.
        For example, in order to retrieve all the subscriptions labeled by `foo=bar`,

        ```sql
        labels.key = 'foo' and labels.value = 'bar'
        ```

        If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
        all the accounts that the user has permission to see will be
        returned.
