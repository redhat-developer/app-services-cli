Manage Service Registry roles using a set of commands that give users one of following permissions:

* viewer (provides read access)
* manager (provides read and write access)
* admin (provides admin access as well as read and write access)

Roles can be applied to users (for example, "martin_redhat") and Service Account Client IDs (for example, "srvc-acct-03ddedba-5b49-4aa0-9b68-02e8b8c31add").
These commands are accessible only to users with the organization admin role or owners of the Service Registry instance.
