Connect an application service to your application running on OpenShift or Kubernetes. This command uses the Service Binding Operator to inject an application running on the cluster with the parameters required to connect to the application service.

When you perform service binding, the Service Binding Operator automatically injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application (you can see these files in the “/bindings” directory in your application). This means that the application automatically detects and uses the injected connection parameters.

In general, this automatic injection and detection of connection parameters eliminates the need to manually configure an application to connect to an application service. This is a particular advantage if you have many applications in your project that you want to connect to the application service.

If your application uses a “DeploymentConfig”, you must use the “--deployment-config" flag so that your application can be detected.

Connect your application services to an Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

Note: Before you can connect your application service to OpenShift, you need to install the RHOAS Operator in your OpenShift cluster. For installation instructions, see https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-guides/tree/main/service-discovery#installing-the-rhoas-operator-on-openshift.

When you connect an application service to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, this command uses the kubeconfig file (or the KUBECONFIG environment variable) to connect to the cluster and identify the context.

After identifying the context, the RHOAS Operator creates a service account and mounts it as a secret in your cluster. If your cluster has a service account already, the service account is refreshed.

Finally, the RHOAS Operator creates a Kafka Request Object, which the Service Binding Operator (https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator) uses to create a "ServiceBinding" object.

After running this command, you need to grant access for the service account that was created by the RHOAS Operator to access your application service. For the Kafka application service, enter the following command:

  $ rhoas kafka acl grant-access --producer --consumer --service-account your-sa --topic all --group all

For the Service Registry application service, enter this command:

  $ rhoas service-registry role add --role=manager --service-account your-sa

Additionally RHOAS Operator and Service Binding Operators needs to be installed.

To install the RHOAS Operator in the OpenShift web console:

1. Navigate to the Operators > OperatorHub page.

2. In the Filter by Keyword box, type "rhoas".
